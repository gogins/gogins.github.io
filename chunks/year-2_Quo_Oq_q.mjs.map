This was the first commit to the strudel repo:\n\n```log\ncommit 38b5a0d5cdf28685b2b5e18d460772b70246207b\nAuthor: Alex McLean <alex@slab.org>\nDate:   Sat Jan 22 20:24:36 2022 +0000\n\nInitial commit\n```\n\nI have already written these 2 posts about the first year of strudel:\n\n- [Introducing Strudel](https://loophole-letters.vercel.app/strudel)\n- [1 Year of Strudel](https://loophole-letters.vercel.app/strudel1year)\n\nTo continue that tradition, let me recap what happened around Strudel in 2023, at least what I have noticed:\n\n## ICLC 2023\n\nI presented strudel at the [International Conference on Live Coding (ICLC)](https://iclc.toplap.org/2023/), which took place in April in Utrecht.\nHere is the (pretty technical) video of my presentation:\n\nimport { Youtube } from '@src/components/Youtube';\n\n<Youtube client:only=\"react\" id=\"ZzDSW08IAdU\" params=\"start=2805\" />\n\nFor the conference, I wrote a paper with Alex McLean, called [Strudel: Live Coding Patterns on the Web](https://zenodo.org/records/7842142).\nFor me personally, this was my first major contact with the live coding scene and it was a very memorable experience!\n\n## Workshops and Courses\n\nA lot of workshops have been using strudel in the last year, from many parts of the world:\n[Iceland](http://www.raflost.is/live-coding-for-beginners/), [UK](https://gutlevel.co.uk/whatson/patternclub8),\n[Japan](https://yoppa.org/kanazawa23), [France](https://www.stereolux.org/agenda/workshop-de-decouverte-de-la-musique-algorithmique-avec-strudel-avec-camille-amet) and the [US](https://www.nycresistor.com/2023/09/25/making-music-with-code-9-30-2023/) (probably more I've missed).\nI've also given workshops in [Switzerland](https://basel.codes/2023/index.html) and [Germany](https://www.cityofmediaarts.de/de/events/strudel-live-coding-workshop/), where we even had real strudel, thanks to [TOPLAP Karlsruhe](https://toplap-ka.de/)!\n\n![strudel workshop space](/img/workshop-space.png)\n\nAdditionally, there is now a [Creative Coding](https://www.chalmers.se/en/collaborate-with-us/activities-for-schools/creative-coding/) course at Chalmers in Sweden, consisting of \"a 10-week series of workshops [...] for younger girls to have fun and experiment with code and music\".\nI was very delighted to see this video of the girls having fun with Strudel:\n\n<Youtube client:only=\"react\" id=\"4zgHeNpG4wU\" />\n\nThe course was also encompassed by a study on female empowerement through Creative Coding, read more in [Jasmina Maric's paper \"Singing Code\"](https://www.academia.edu/106106710/Singing_Code).\n\nAnother bigger installment was the [(Algo|Afro) Futures programme](https://algo-afro-futures.lurk.org/) led by Antonio Roberts, which is \"a mentoring programme for early career Black artists who want to explore creative coding and live coding\".\nFor the final concert they recorded this amazing live stream:\n\n<Youtube client:only=\"react\" id=\"zUoZvkZ3J7Q\" params=\"start=842\" />\n\nI am so happy to see that the project I've co-created has had such an impact already, making live coding workshops more easy and accessible.\nIn my opinion, the reasons why people seem to choose strudel for teaching are:\n\n- it does not require an installation, so it even runs on your phone / tablet or a chromebook\n- in-code and behind-code visualizations help learners to understand what the system is doing\n- the interactive documentation\n- the simple javascript syntax, which is very similar to [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz)\n- tidal's mini notation for playful expression of rhythms (based on the [Bol Processor](https://bolprocessor.org/)'s polymetric expressions)\n- its range of functions for transforming patterns for those getting deeper into exploring strange rhythms\n\n## Performances\n\n![strudel performance](/img/strudel-live-coding-mars-college.jpg)\n\nPeople are starting to use Strudel for performances, many of which can be watched in the new [Showcase](/intro/showcase/)!\nThe above photo comes from the [Mars College Department of Future Music](https://mars.college/gallery/live_coding/)\n\n## New Features\n\nLet's talk about some of the major features that landed since last year.\n\n### Audio Engine Improved\n\nThe audio engine has gotten a lot of attention! Once integrated into Strudel itself, the engine has been pulled out and named [superdough](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superdough),\nthe name being based on [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt), which is the audio engine of Tidal.\nSuperdough is now also used by [topos](https://topos.live/), a creation of [Raphaël Forment](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo/), who helped me implement a bunch of new features.\nLately, [Jade Rowland](https://github.com/daslyfe) has also developed many synthesis features into superdough! Here is a non-exhaustive list of new features:\n\n- [filter envelopes](https://strudel.cc/learn/effects/#filter-envelope) + [24db filter option](https://strudel.cc/learn/effects/#ftype)\n- [pitch envelopes](https://strudel.cc/learn/effects/#pitch-envelope)\n- [fm synthesis](https://strudel.cc/learn/synths/#fm-synthesis)\n- [wavetable synthesis](https://strudel.cc/recipes/recipes/#wavetable-synthesis)\n- [phaser](https://strudel.cc/learn/effects/#phaser)\n- [vibrato](https://strudel.cc/learn/synths/#vibrato)\n- [noise](https://strudel.cc/learn/synths/#noise)\n- [an integration of the zzfx synth](https://strudel.cc/learn/synths/#zzfx)\n- [compressor](https://strudel.cc/learn/effects/#compressor)\n- multichannel audio / audio device selection\n\nimport { MiniRepl } from '@src/docs/MiniRepl';\n\nHere's an example that shows off filter envelopes:\n\n<MiniRepl\n  client:visible\n  tune={`// \"acidic tooth\" @by eddyflux\nsetcps(1)\nstack(\n  note(\"[<g1 f1>/8](<3 5>,8)\")\n  .clip(perlin.range(.15,1.5))\n  .release(.1)\n  .s(\"sawtooth\")\n  .lpf(sine.range(400,800).slow(16))\n  .lpq(cosine.range(6,14).slow(3))\n  .lpenv(sine.mul(4).slow(4))\n  .lpd(.2).lpa(.02)\n  .ftype('24db')\n  .rarely(add(note(12)))\n  .room(.2).shape(.3).postgain(.5)\n  .superimpose(x=>x.add(note(12)).delay(.5).bpf(1000))\n  .gain(\"[.2 1@3]*2\") // fake sidechain\n  ,\n  stack(\n    s(\"bd*2\").mask(\"<0@4 1@16>\"),\n    s(\"hh*8\").gain(saw.mul(saw.fast(2))).clip(sine)\n    .mask(\"<0@8 1@16>\")\n  ).bank('RolandTR909')\n)\n`}\n/>\n\n### Import Sounds\n\nIn the \"sounds\" tab, you can now press \"import sounds\" to select sounds from your local disk, allowing you\nto use your own samples without the need to upload them! Keep in mind that if you share a pattern that uses local samples that the samples will fail to load on other people's machines..\n\n### Community Bakery / Patterns Tab\n\nYou can now share your patterns publicly to the [Community Bakery](/bakery/), via the \"Share\" button!\nThe Community Patterns are also listed in the new \"patterns\", where you can also save your own patterns locally!\n\n### Quality of Life Improvements\n\nYou can now change the theme and font of the editor:\n\n![strudel themes](/img/strudel-themes.png)\n\nYou can now enable autocompletion in the settings:\n\n![autocomplete](/img/autocomplete.png)\n\nIf you enable tooltips, you will get the same info by hovering the mouse over functions while holding the ctrl key!\n\nAnother handy thing is that Strudel now has offline support! Even samples will work once you have played them once. [More info](/learn/pwa/)\n\n### New Visualizations\n\nThere is now a new `.spiral()` visualization that renders events in a spiral, elevating the cyclical nature of time (+ swirl also means Strudel in german).\n\n![strudel alien ui](/img/strudel-alien-live-coding.png)\n\nAh yes and you see one of the less readable fonts in this screenshot too :)\n\nThe `.scope()` function renders you an oscilloscope:\n\n![scope](/img/strudel-scope.png)\n\nThe pianoroll also got some more options, including the ability to set labels:\n\n![scope](/img/strudel-monkeys.png)\n\n### Sliders\n\nThe `slider` is the first of a family of functions that render UI widgets inline:\n\n<MiniRepl\n  client:visible\n  tune={`note(\"<c eb g bb>*8\")\n  .s(\"sawtooth\").lpenv(2).lpq(8)\n  .lpf(slider(500, 100, 2000, 1))`}\n/>\n\nSliders are especially useful for gradual changes like fading things in and out by hand,\nwhich is not very practical with just code. The fact that the slider is inside the code and also changes the code itself,\nmakes it feel connected to the rest of the system + doesn't distract or obstruct from the code.\nOther widgets will come for sure.\n\n### More Voicings\n\nOne of my personal goals that got me involved with live coding in the first place is to be able to generate good sounding chord voicings on the fly.\nStrudel now supports most chord symbols:\n\n<MiniRepl\n  client:visible\n  tune={`chord(\"<C^9 C7b9 Fm9 Db^7>/2\")\n  .dict('ireal').voicing()\n  .s(\"sawtooth\")\n  .lpf(400).lpa(.5).lpenv(4)\n  .phaser(4).room(.5)`}\n/>\n\nSo far, this is only [documented briefly](https://strudel.cc/learn/tonal/#voicing), a more in-depth guide will follow!\n\n### Multiplayer / Collaborative Coding\n\nThe collaborative live coding editor [flok](https://flok.cc) had strudel support early on, thanks to [Damián Silvani](https://github.com/munshkr).\nLater, I've added [support for multiple strudel instances](https://github.com/munshkr/flok/pull/181), which was merged to the official version [just a few days ago](https://social.toplap.org/@munshkr/111748783047032711).\nThis photo shows a flok jam I did with my workshop participants in basel:\n\n![collaborative coding](/img/strudel-collaborative-coding.png)\n\nThe cool thing about flok is that you can jam with people on the other side of the planet!\nHere is a recording of the first session we organized over the discord server:\n\n<Youtube client:only=\"react\" id=\"p0J7XrT9JEs\" params=\"start=2634\" />\n\n### Better MIDI integration\n\nThe midi integration has gotten a few new features:\n\n- [clock out](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/pull/710) to sync your midi devices / DAW to the strudel clock (better doc coming soon)\n- [cc output](https://strudel.cc/learn/input-output/#ccn--ccv) to send cc values to your gear\n- [cc input](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/pull/699) to control strudel via MIDI (better doc coming soon)\n\nHere is a little demo of me fiddling with a midi controller, changing a piano pattern:\n\n<Youtube client:only=\"react\" id=\"e2-Sv_jjDQk\" />\n\n### Experimental Features\n\n- You can now run [hydra inside strudel](https://strudel.cc/learn/hydra/) + you can even run strudel in [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz), thanks to [Olivia Jack](https://ojack.xyz/) and [Ámbar Tenorio Fornés](https://atenor.io/)! Read more [here](https://alpaca.pubpub.org/pub/b7hwrjfk/release/2?readingCollection=1def0192)\n- There is now a [VSCode Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=roipoussiere.tidal-strudel) thanks to [roipoussiere](https://github.com/roipoussiere)! It allows you run patterns from a `.strudel` file inside VSCode.\n- Strudel can now be downloaded as a desktop app, thanks to [vasilymilovidov](https://github.com/vasilymilovidov) who has wrapped the REPL with [tauri](https://tauri.app/). You can download it [on the releases page](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel/releases) (scroll down to Assets). The performance is not optimal on MacOS and Linux, which is why it is still considered experimental\n\n## Stats\n\nLet's end the recap with some naked numbers:\n\n### Releases\n\n- 0.0.2 Schwindlig\n-
